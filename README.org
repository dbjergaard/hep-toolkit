** Panda Parse
panda_parse is a python script that will open your panda jobs page
and print two files panda_retrieve.txt for datasets that had less
than 5% failure rate and panda_resubmit.txt for datasets that should
be resubmitted. If a dataset needs to be resubmitted, the output
datset name is printed to stdout.  

Everything is hard coded right now.  If I have time some day I might
make it more user friendly.
*** Requirements
- Beautiful Soup 4
- urllib
- python 2.7+
** purge_cern_inbox
This is a working example of how to parse imap requests in
python... Its very specific, but could be tailored to do more
sophisticated things (like manage Panda jobs from a chron job and
resubmit until 100% success rate)
