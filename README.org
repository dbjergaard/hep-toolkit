** Panda Parse
panda_parse is a python script that will open your panda jobs page
and print two files panda_retrieve.txt for datasets that had less
than 5% failure rate and panda_resubmit.txt for datasets that should
be resubmitted. If a dataset needs to be resubmitted, the output
datset name is printed to stdout.  

Everything is hard coded right now.  If I have some day I might make
it more user friendly.
